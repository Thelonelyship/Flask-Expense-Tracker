Hi!

Link to live project via Render.com = https://flask-expense-tracker-p0pu.onrender.com

The biggest issue I faced with this project is uploading the file with a working SQL database. It was originally saved via localhost and I got many errors when trying to upload. I did some research and found SQL Online which provides you with one free database. Using this worked.

However, there was the issue that the data would be shared amongst all users. This is no good for a personal expense tracker.

I did some research and then changed it by adding JavaScript to save the user inputs to localstorage. That way they should only see what they entered.

If you have any suggestions on alternatives, please let me know.
