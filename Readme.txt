Hi!

Link to live project via Render.com = https://flask-expense-tracker-p0pu.onrender.com

This Flask / Python task originally worked using a MySQL database. I didn't like that everybody could see the same data so I changed it to Javascript to store data locally. I then discovered sessions and now the Javascript has been removed and it uses Flask to store the data to the session instead. I feel like this is more on task.

In the future, I would like to build on this and add a login to allow individual users to store their own data.
